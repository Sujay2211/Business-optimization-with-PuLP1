## 🧮 Problem Statement

A furniture company manufactures **Tables** and **Chairs**.  
Each product generates profit and consumes two key resources: **wood** and **labor**.

- **Profit per Table**: ₹2,500  
- **Profit per Chair**: ₹1,500  
- **Resources per Table**: 10 units of wood, 7 labor hours  
- **Resources per Chair**: 5 units of wood, 4 labor hours  
- **Total Available Resources**:  
  - Wood: 400 units  
  - Labor: 280 hours

### 🎯 Objective:
Maximize total profit by deciding the optimal number of tables and chairs to produce.
